#'complex' ajaxian form
natures.beasts=Nature's Beasts

#easy ajax
easyajax.intro=Code of the two components on this page is identical. They behave a little differently though&mdash;upper component communicates with server by HTTP requests and the bottom one by XMLHttpRequests. This was just achieved by adding about two lines of code to template that renders bottom component. Using so called 'update regions' it is easy to make application behave in AJAXian manner. Those requests asynchronously update only part of your page allows end-user to continue with his business process without the delay that would otherwise occur while waiting for response.

#friendly update
ufriendly.component.title=Cooperative form
ufriendly.component.intro=Cooperative forms only require user to enter minimum amount of data. Everything that can be deduced from the given information is. In this form this works as follows: when business registration number is filled in, other data can be fetched from central registry by pressing the corresponding button. At the same time, user can continue filling of the invoice data.
ufriendly.component.getdata=Fetch data from central registry
ufriendly.component.centralfirmid=Business registration number
ufriendly.component.registryaddress=Registered location
ufriendly.component.postaladdress=Postal address
ufriendly.component.bankaccount=Bank account
ufriendly.component.vatidentifier=VAT number
ufriendly.component.firmtype=Company type
ufriendly.component.invoice.id=Invoice identification number
ufriendly.component.invoice.date=Date of invoice
ufriendly.component.invoice.sum=Sum of invoice
ufriendly.public.limited=Public Ltd
ufriendly.npo=NPO
ufriendly.private.limited=Private Ltd
ufriendly.cform.reset=Reset form

#context menu
context.menu.compheader=Widget with context menu
context.menu.intro=It is possible to customize the right-click contextmenu of your application. You can attach the customized contextmenu to page, list, form input field&mdash;to any component that might need it.
context.menu.howto=Right-click anywhere inside this component to open a customized context-menu with one sublevel.
context.menu.ChangeSex=Change sex

#simple list sorting and paging
simple.list.sort.page=Simple list w/ paging&sorting support
simple.list.rolistintro=Creating read-only list from a bunch of model objects is really easy. Developer just declares the class of the model objects and the fields that should be shown and <a href="http://www.araneaframework.org/docs/1.2/javadoc/org/araneaframework/uilib/list/BeanListWidget.html">BeanListWidget</a> takes care of the rest&mdash;paging and sorting are provided without any additional code.
simple.list.howtonavigate=You can try out the sorting by clicking on the list header names and paging by using the navigation bar at the list bottom.

demo.beanForm.tab=Tutorial First Bean Form
demo.beanForm.intro=This widget demonstrates the simplicity of using bean forms in Aranea. In addition, it shows that it's possible to bind primitives to form controls, if they are mandatory because primitives don't support null values.
demo.beanForm.caseSensitive=Case sensitive
demo.beanForm.searchString=Search string
demo.beanForm.createdDateTime=Created (date & time)
demo.beanForm.createdTime=Created (time)
demo.beanForm.createdDate=Created (date)
demo.beanForm.length=Length (BigDecimal)
demo.beanForm.siblingsCount=Siblings count (int)
demo.beanForm.peopleCount=People count (long)
demo.beanForm.weight=Weight (float)
demo.beanForm.preciseWeight=Precise weight (double)

#seamless validation form
seamless.bg.form=Form w/ seamless background validation
seamless.withoutbg.form=Form with traditional on-submit validation 
seamless.appointmentdate=Appointment date
seamless.appointmenttime=Appointment time
seamless.room=Room
seamless.attendees=Attendees
seamless.intro=Often instant feedback is desired in applications&mdash;user should not be allowed to proceed too far with his business process when his initial assumptions were incorrect and at the end he would be presented with some validation error screen. Aranea forms can be configured to perform validation as user fills it (opposed to the traditional approach when validation is performed when submitting the form). This prevents the delays and misunderstandings. Because this is implemented asynchronously there are no interrupts during input procedure and when form is finally submitted it will contain only acceptable data.
seamless.howto=Of two forms on this page, upper form is validated only on submit, lower one is validated seamlessly. Try it out by entering some invalid values. Keep in mind that not all rooms are available and not everyone is always able to attend meetings.
seamless.rooms.atrium=Atrium
seamless.rooms.olympic=Casino Olympic
seamless.rooms.colosseum=Colosseum
seamless.rooms.rld=Red Light District
seamless.rooms.warroom=War Room
seamless.room.not.available=Room ''{0}'' is already reserved
seamless.attendees.not.available=''{0}'' cannot attend the meeting (they are preoccupied or dead)

#autocomplete release demo
release.ac.onchangetext=Changed, value is
release.ac.submitvalid=Submitted value is:  
ac.demo.title=Autocomplete (suggestion) demo
ac.demo.intro=It is well known fact that users do not know what they really want. With input suggestions, you can help them to overcome their initial cluelessness and maybe learn correct spelling of long words :)
ac.demo.howto=When you type at least one character in input field below, browser will ask the server for suggested completions (which in this case are country names). User is by no means tied to suggested inputs though, 'M\u00e4gi-Karabahh' is as feasible input to below text-field as any other.

#combotextselectinput
combo.demo.fieldinput=Consultant name
combo.intro=Combines input and select elements, making it a lot easier to use long classified values in the page. An example could be a dropdown with several hundred records.
combo.submitmessage=Entered value was:

#poll
poll.taskmsg=You have a new task, task number is ''{0}''. Task was created at ''{1}''.

#modal dialgo demo
modal.demo.startnext=Start next
modal.demo.startnextoverlay=Start next in overlay
modal.demo.previous=Return to previous
modal.demo.title=Modal dialog demo
modal.demo.intro=There are times when one needs to prevent users from wandering around in parallel usecases, shooting themselves in the foot at the go. Aranea provides a way to present all fully-functional Aranea components in modal dialogs (aka <i>overlay</i>), allowing user to complete a parallel usecase or just respond to an alert. This avoids the need to open additional browser windows that are often blocked by modern browsers or might just go unnoticed by user.
modal.demo.howto=Start another identical widget by clicking on a "Start next" or "Start next in overlay" buttons. Once the modal dialog (overlay mode) is activated, both buttons will act identically. When overlay completes (this will happen when "Return to previous" button is used in activated overlay where there are no more flows that are running inside overlay), user is returned to main usecase.

#tree
servletcontext.tree.title=Powerful tree component
servletcontext.tree.intro=Aranea tree component allows for easy navigation of complex hierarchical structures. Backing datastore resides on server and only parts that are currently shown to user are fetched to client. Demos below demonstrate two approaches of communication&mdash;first makes use of usual Aranea event API (produces HTTP requests here because no update regions are used), the other one uses Aranea Action API. Switching between the two models is as easy as calling <code>Treewidget.setUseActions(true)</code>.
servletcontext.tree.more=Although current example does not demonstrate this, it is also easy to customize rendering for each tree node. One can have each node rendered differently, if he so desires.
servletcontext.treew.events=Tree with events:
servletcontext.treew.actions=Tree with actions:

#tabs
tabs.intro=When user has lots of power, it is sometimes nice to lay this power out in a logically separated way. The tab widget that enjoys wide popularity in all sorts of UI interfaces provides clean approach to do just that. Navigation between your business processes in tabs can be done without the worries of state being lost.

#simple editable list
SimpleEditableList=Simple editable list
sed.title=Editable list w/ filtering, modification, deletion and addition support
sed.Forename=Name
sed.Surname=Surname
sed.Sex=Sex
sed.sexcon.ermsg=Field ''{0}'' must contain valid sex ('M' or 'F').
sed.intro=Read-only lists provide great overview of records, but do not directly allow modification. For easy modification, one can choose to use editable lists.
sed.howtonavigate=You can try out filtering by filling some filter fields and pressing 'Return' key or clicking 'Filter' button. Addition of new record is done by filling data fields at the bottom of the list and clicking on 'Add' button. List field can be modified by activating edit mode (separate button for this is in each row).

#examples varia
person.add.form.label=Adding person
person.edit.form.label=Editing person
company.add.form.label=Adding company
company.edit.form.label=Editing company

aranea.item1=Back-button support
aranea.item1.desc=Aranea now allows user to click the back button of the browser to move \
to the previous pages. This feature is largely based on rsh \

and is optional (turned off by default, but \
<a href="http://www.araneaframework.org/docs/1.2/reference/html/framework.html#StateVersioningContext" target="_blank">documentation</a> \
describes how to turn this feature on).

aranea.item2=Updated scripts
aranea.item2.desc=Aranea 1.2 comes with update-to-date JavaScript dependencies \
(e.g. <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/" target="_blank">protoypeJS</a>, \
<a href="http://script.aculo.us/" target="_blank">script.aculo.us</a>, and \
<a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/" target="_blank">tinyMCE</a>). Therefore, \
you can take advantatage of all the latest features they provide.

aranea.item3=Small but significant enhancements
aranea.item3.desc=Last but not least, Aranea 1.2 has received some small updates for better quality: \
<ul><li>SelectControl can now localize \
(through <code>ConfigurationContext</code> or by setting an option of a JSP tag of \
<code>SelectControl</code>) and sort its data</li>\
<li>lower/greater-than-or-equal have been changed for shorter output ("a &lt;= b" vs. "(a &lt; b OR a = b)"</li>\
<li>the cache time of JavaScipts can now be configured</li>\
<li>overlay dialog now has limited height and does not overflow anymore</li>\
<li>OverlayContext can be closed with one command (vs. multiple <code>cancel()</code><code>finish()</code>)</li>\
<li><code>EnvironmentUtil</code> has more methods to retrieve items for the <code>Environment</code></li>\
<li>&lt;ui:importStyles/&gt and &lt;ui:importScripts/&gt now \
<a href="http://www.araneaframework.org/docs/1.2/reference/html/jsp.html#systemTags" target="_blank">import new file groups</a></li></ul>


aranea.whattomigrate.title=What needs to be done to migrate from Aranea 1.1 -&gt; 1.2?
