    <para>
       When serving AJAX requests made with AjaxAnywhere (see <xref linkend="ajaxanywhere"/>), extracts from
       the initial response these page regions that need to be updated (request includes the names of these regions), then 
       modifies the response to include just these regions (not the whole page).

                    <entry>When the filter is activated, it tries to extract specified regions from response, even
                    if they were not explicitly asked to be updated in request. This is useful for always updating
                    some common page regions (feedback message regions etc). Some default region names
                    that should be updated when AJAX request is made are <literal>messages</literal>, 
                    <literal>popupRegistrationRegion</literal>, <literal>scrolling</literal>.</entry>
