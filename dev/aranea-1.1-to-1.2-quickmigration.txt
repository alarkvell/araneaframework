Migrating from Aranea 1.1 to 1.2

This document covers API changes in Aranea 1.2. Read this through to undestand
your cost of migration.

Overall, the changes were kept close to minimum, and should not cause great
trouble.

Be sure to a√∂sp read Changelog.txt for additional information on what's changed.

----------------------
Version 1.2 2008-11-25
----------------------

1) interface FlowContext: removed deprecated stuff along with corresponding
   code in implementing classes:

	public FlowReference getCurrentReference();
	public interface FlowReference extends Serializable {...}

2) class ListStructure: changed
	protected AndFilter getAndFilter() {...}
   to
	protected MultiFilter getFilter() {...}
   because the previous one was too specific and didn't allow custom
   MultiFilters (e.g OrFilter).

3) interface OverlayContext: added void cancel() and void finish(Object result)
   that close the entire OverlayContext and return back to the flow that
   initiated the OverlayContext.

4) intefaces EventListener and ActionListener: changed the type of eventId and
   actionId from Object to String because it caused too many caused
   unnecessary casts. Also changed implementing classes.

5) Moved event and action handler invoking to ProxiedHandlerUtil:

	void invokeEventHandler(String eventId, String eventParam, Widget eventTarget)
	void invokeActionHandler(String actionId, String actionParam, Widget actionTarget)

   Also changed code in many places to use central handler invoking.

6) <ui:importStyles /> and <ui:importScripts /> - the names of the groups have
   been changed:

   Styles: all, aranea, calendar, contextmenu, modalbox, prototip

   Scripts: all, core-all, core, calendar, calendar_et, modalbox, rsh,
            prototip, logger, tinyMCE
