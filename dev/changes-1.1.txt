API changes in 1.1
------------------

[Diff from 1.13.1.1 to 2.1.1.44]

* Component-s know their own Id-s (added getScope method). Interface Scope and
  its implementation StandardScope have been added. Component's init method now
  takes Scope as its first parameter. Implementation of that was done in
  BaseComponent.
* Component-s have environment now (added getEnvironment method).
* Components' lifecycle is more strictly defined, there are three states:
  UNBORN, ALIVE and DEAD. Resurrection cannot occur anymore, an
  IllegalStateException is thrown. Leftover calls do not throw exceptions
  anymore, they are silently ignored. BaseComponent implementation manages the
  lifecycle status. In addition to the existing isInitialized method, the
  protected methods isAlive and isDead were added to BaseComponent class.
  Propagate call does not traverse below dead Component. BaseService lets the
  action call through only if the Component is alive. The convertInternal
  method in FormElement class runs the conversion and addInitEvent method in
  FormElement and ListWidget classes run the event only if the element/widget
  is alive.
* Added another constructor to StandardPath class, which takes Collection as an
  argument.
* Deleted FLOW_KEY and CALL_STACK_KEY constants from FlowContext interface.
  StandardFlowContainerWidget: frames have fixed names (generated sequentially)
  that are used for components ids, because component id's are fixed.

* Eliminated OutputData attributes: deleted pushAttribute, popAttribute,
  getAttribute and getAttributes methods from OutputData interface (and
  StandardServletOutputData class).
* Eliminated OutputData and InputData scoping: deleted getScope, pushScope,
  popScope and restoreScope methods from InputData (and
  StandardServletInputData) and OutputData (TODO StandardServletOutputData).
  Method getScopedData in InputData (and StandardServletInputData) now takes
  Path as a parameter. Everything uses getScope method (from Component) instead
  of OutputData/InputData.getScope.
* Eliminated scopedWidgetId, scopedFullId and formScopedFullId, they were the
  same as their non-scoped counterparts anyway. Deleted WIDGET_SCOPED_ID_KEY
  constant from WidgetTag class and FORM_SCOPED_FULL_ID_KEY from FormTag class.
  Deleted scopedFullId field from BaseWidgetTag class. Deleted formScopedFullId
  field and getScopedFullFieldId method from BaseFormElementHtmlTag class.
* Added getContainerPath and getContextPath methods to HttpInputData interface
  (and its implementing class StandardServletInputData).

* Added ExpiringServiceContext interface (implemented by
  BaseExpiringServiceRouterService class), in order to access serviceTTLMap
  from BodyHtmlTag.writeKeepAliveRegistrationScripts (was previously done with
  OutputData attributes).
* Deleted LOCALIZATION_CONTEXT_KEY constant from LocalizationContext interface.
* Deleted MESSAGE_KEY constant from MessageContext interface. Added getMessages
  method to MessageContext interface (and its implementation to
  StandardMessagingFilterWidget class) in order to access messages from
  MessagesHtmlTag class (was previously done with OutputData attributes, which
  were added in render method of StandardMessagingFilterWidget class).
* Deleted POPUPS_KEY constant from PopupWindowContext interface. Added
  getPopups method to PopupWindowContext interface (and
  StandardPopupFilterWidget class) in order to access popup windows from
  PopupRegistrationHtmlTag class.
* Deleted SCROLL_HANDLER_KEY constant from WindowScrollPositionContext
  interface. WindowScrollPositionContext, used by
  ScrollHandlerRegistrationHtmlTag class, is now accessible from environment.
* Deleted PATH_ARGUMENT constant from PathInfoServiceRouterService class.
  Added getPathInfo method to PathInfoServiceContext interface (and
  PathInfoServiceRouterService class).
* Deleted ClientStateUtil class. Added EnvironmentUtil class, that contains
  convenience methods for getting topServiceId and threadServiceId.

* Moved constant ACTION_PATH_KEY from ... to ApplicationService interface.
* Moved constant EVENT_PATH_KEY from StandardContainerWidget class to
  ApplicationWidget interface.

* JSP contextAttributes from parent JSP-s are no longer accessible after
  widgetInclude (for example, layout tags don't work across widgetInclude-s).
  They are deliberatly removed from PageContext in all widgetInclude-like tags
  (WidgetIncludeTag, TreeTag, WizardBodyTag) before calling render, by calling
  BaseTag.hideGlobalContextEntries method. Afterwards, they are restored, by
  calling BaseTag.restoreGlobalContextEntries method.
* Also added getEnvironment, getContextWidget and getContextWidgetFullId
  methods to BaseTag class. //FIXME make addGlobalContextEntry (-> set?) and resetGlobalContextEntries private?
  Deleted static method getWidgetFromContext and renamed
  getContextWidgetFromContext method to getContextWidget in JspWidgetUtil
  class.
* Deleted AraneaRootTag, AraneaViewPortTag, GlobalWidgetIncludeTag classes.
  Deleted ViewPortContext and UiWidgetContainer interfaces and
  UiAraneaWidgetContainer class. Deleted static method getContainer from
  JspWidgetCallUtil class. Deleted container field from BaseWidgetTag class.
* Moved AraneaRootTag.StringAdapterResourceBundle inner class into
  ServeletUtil class. Added LOCALIZATION_CONTEXT_KEY constant to ServeletUtil
  class. JSP localizationContext is set in ServletUtil.include instead of root
  tag. //FIXME make it optional?
* Deleted StandardContainerWidget because viewport tag and ViewPortContext
  interface do not exist anymore. Moved other functionality (about not letting
  non-existent) events through) to StandardWidgetAdapterService class.
* WidgetContext tag with no Id no longer has to be at the top of JSP file, this
  is done automatically in ServletUtil.include. //FIXME eliminate no-Id use-case of WidgetContext tag?
* Added CONTEXT_WIDGET_KEY constant to WidgetContextTag class. Instead of
  pushing/popping the scope of OutputData, the current contextwidget is stored
  in a contextentry. Deleted contextWidgetId field from BaseFormElementHtmlTag
  class.
* Eliminated systemForm's Id. No duplicate systemform check is done in
  server-side nor client-side. Client-side JavaScript searches for the first
  form tag with arn-systemForm attribute. Removed systemFormId field from
  BaseSimpleButtonTag and BaseFormElementHtmlTag classes. The
  get*OnChangePrecondition methods in BaseFormDateTimeInputHtmlTag class and
  fillXJSCallConstructor method in FormDateTimeInputHtmlTag and
  FormTimeInputHtmlTag classes and writeHourSelect and staticFillXJSCall
  methods in FormTimeInputHtmlTag class do not take systemFormId as an argument
  any more. The constructACUrl and constructServiceParameter methods in
  FormAutoCompleteTextInputHtmlTag class and static method
  getSubmitScriptForEvent in JspWidgetCallUtil class do not take systemFormId
  as an argument any more.
* Added SystemFormContext interface and its implementation
  StandardSystemFormFilterService. Filters lower in the hierarchy (like
  TransactionFilter and ClientStateFilter) can use it to add fields to
  systemform, that must be written out in HTML by systemform tag.
  StandardSystemFormFilterService adds topServiceId and threadServiceId
  automatically, since these filters are located higher in the hierarchy.
* Deleted JSP_CONFIGURATION_KEY constant from JspContext interface.
* Added getSubmitCharset, getFormAction, getTagMapping, getConfiguration
  methods to JspContext interface; moved methods the same four method
  implementations from StandardJspFilterService.JspConfiguration inner class to
  StandardJspFilterService class. Removed getCurrentBundle, getCurrentLocale,
  getJspPath, getJspExtension methods from
  StandardJspFilterService.JspConfiguration inner class and deleted the inner
  class altogether. Thus, StandardJspFilterService doesn't depend on
  LocalizationContext anymore.
* There are now two ServletUtil.include methods, in addition to the old one
  that takes Environment as a parameter, the new one takes ApplicationWidget
  instead. When ServletUtil.include is invoked from an ApplicationWidget (as is
  mostly the case), the new method signature should be used - then the
  including widget is made accessible to JSP. In addition to the including
  widget, ServletUtil.include sets the environment, JSP localization context
  and also the same five entries that widgetContext tag did. After including
  the JSP, the contextEntries that were set, are restored to previous values.
* Added getEnvironment method to ServletUtil class.
* The SPAN HTML tag surrounding a formelement does not have a random id any
  more (due to non-preservable contextattributes). The id is in the form of
  "fe-span-${fullFormElementId}". Deleted static method generateId from
  BaseFormElementHtmlTag class.

JavaScript:
* getSystemForm and setSystemForm functions were added to AraneaPage instance.
  findSystemForm function was added to AraneaPage object. It searches for the
  first form tag with arn-systemForm attribute and calls setSystemForm. It is
  added as a systemLoadEvent, so it is called on page load [and after
  updateregions AJAX request???].
* Because element-based traversing is not performed anymore, deleted
  AraneaTraverser and removed getTraverser function from AraneaPage instance
  (aranea.js). Moved the five getEvent* functions from AraneaTraverser to
  AraneaPage instance.
* Moved setFormEncoding function from aranea-ui.js to AraneaPage instance
  (aranea.js) and renamed it to setSystemFormEncoding.
* JavaScript functions related to date and time controls (fillTimeText,
  fillTimeSelect) and scrollhandler (saveScrollCoordinates) do not take
  systemForm as a parameter anymore (aranea-ui.js).
* getActionSubmitURL, action and action_6 functions in AraneaPage instance take
  sync as an additional parameter. In action and action_6 methods, the sync
  parameter was added to the middle of the signature, not as the last
  parameter (//TODO fix it?).


* UpdateRegion filter is a widget filter now. UpdateRegions use partial
  rendering (updateRegion names have widget name prefixed with ':' as
  separator).
* Eliminated globalUpdateRegions. Messages and popups data is sent in JSON
  format, they have JavaScript handlers in client-side.

* Deleted StandardSynchronizingFilterService, its functionality is merged into
  StandardHttpSessionRouterService. Deleted SynchronizingContext interface.
* Added SYNC_PARAMETER_KEY and SESSION_SYNC_OBJECT_KEY constants to
  StandardHttpSessionRouterService class.
* StandardHttpSessionRouterService supports unsynchronized actions - when
  sync=false is specified as a request parameter.
* Utility classes Mutex, ReadWriteLock, ReaderPreferenceReadWriteLock, Sync,
  WriterPreferenceReadWriteLock have been added from
  EDU.oswego.cs.dl.util.concurrent package.
* StandardHttpSessionRouterService and StandardSerializingAuditFilterService
  use a read-write lock to track the progress of action calls and to know when
  all calls have finished so that session can be serialized.
* StandardSerializingAuditFilterService class extends BaseFilterService
  (previously extended BaseService and implemented FilterService).

* TreeWidget supports unsynchronized actions. In client-side JavaScript,
  unsynchronized action is made when the tree HTML element has
  arn-tree-sync="false" attribute (aranea-tree.js) That attribute is written
  out in TreeTag.StandardTreeRenderer.renderTreeStart method. Added
  useSynchronizedActions method to TreeContext interface and TreeWidget class,
  added setUseSynchronizedActions method to TreeWidget class.
* The render* methods in TreeRenderer interface and
  TreeTag.StandardTreeRenderer class do not take nodeFullId nor childNodeFullId
  as arguments any more.
* Added getFullId method to TreeNodeContext interface and TreeNodeWidget class.

* You are able to query the next transactionId from TransactionHelper and
  TransactionContext (added getNextTransactionId method to both).
* StandardTransactionFilterWidget and StandardClientStateFilterWidget require
  SystemFormContext from environment (provided by
  StandardSystemFormFilterService).


* Event listeners ProxyEventListener, ProxyOnChangeEventListener,
  ProxyOnClickEventListener and ValidatingProxyEventListener take Widget as
  constructor parameter instead of Object. Also, the eventTarget field is of
  type Widget.
