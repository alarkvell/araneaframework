 * Represents an object with a set of child components. In a <tt>Composite</tt>, children can form a hierarchy having (

 * This class should not be directly implemented, but {@link CompositeComponent}, {@link CompositeService} or

 * This contract follows the template pattern by defining <code>_getComposite</code> which returns the implementation.

 * The <tt>Composite</tt> contract itself does not expose direct methods for accessing its child components, since they
 * are protected and handled by implementations.
