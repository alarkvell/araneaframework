  Contains the constraint classes, which may be used to impose arbitary constraints on the form data. Of course, no one
  is restricted to using only those constraints provided here. Here are some basic classes to use for extending and
  creating custom constraints:
  <ul>
    <li><code>BaseConstraint</code> - the most basic constraint class providing essential functionality to simplify the
      work of its sub-classes.</li>
    <li><code>BaseGenericFieldConstraint</code> - a constraint class for implementing <code>GenericFormElement</code>
      (common super class for <code>FormWidget</code>s  and <code>FormElement</code>s) specific validation. Note that
      <code>GenericFormElement</code> can return the value of the element but does not provide direct access to the
      label of the element (e.g. <code>FormWidget</code>s don't have labels).</li>
    <li><code>BaseFieldConstraint</code> - a constraint class for implementing <code>FormElement</code> specific
      validation (this is usually the most used base class, because it also provides the label of form element).</li>
  </ul>

  In addition, some advanced constraints are designed to contain and handle multiple constraints so that more
  complicated constaints could be created:
  <ul>
    <li><code>AndConstraint</code> - a constraint containing other constraints where each constraint must be validated
      successfully in order to make this constraint validate. By default, it works in lazy mode, i.e. processes its
      contained constraints until first constraint fails to validate successfully.</li>
    <li><code>OrConstraint</code> - a constraint containing other constraints where at least one constraint must be
      validated successfully in order to make this constraint validate. By default, it works in lazy mode, i.e.
      processes its contained constraints until first successfully validating constraint is reached.</li>
    <li><code>ConstraintGroupHelper</code> - an advanced helper that simplifies the task of assigning constraints to
      different form elements and simplifies controling which group of constraints should be validated.</li>
  </ul>
