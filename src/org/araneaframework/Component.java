 * A components life-cycle is simple. It starts with initiation and ends with destruction.
 * <ul>
 * <li>A component once initiated, cannot be re-initiated.
 * <li>A component once destroyed, cannot be re-initiated.
 * <li>A component not initiated, cannot be destroyed.
 * </ul>
 * When a life-cycle contract is broken, {@link org.araneaframework.core.exception.AraneaRuntimeException} will be
 * thrown.
 * <p>
 * The component is initialized with an {@link Environment}, which cannot be altered during or after the initialization
 * process.
 * <p>
 * The Component follows the template pattern by defining <code>_getComponent()</code> which returns the implementation.
 * The implementation is used for managing the component life-cycle. The Component contract itself does not expose
 * direct life-cycle methods, since they are protected and handled by implementations.
