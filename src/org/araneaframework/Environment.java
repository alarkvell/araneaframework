/**
 * A special data structure providing encapsulation of data needed by different components. 
 * Every Aranea component has an environment. The environment can be inherited from the parent
 * or be stand-alone. No component knows from which component the Environment comes from.
 * <p>
 * Component does know about the hooks in the environment. As different contexts are added to
 * the environment the component in need of them is responsible of checking them and acting upon
 * them. 
 * <p>
 * Since version XXX of Aranea there are some restrictions of the content of the environments: the keys
 * should be class literals and the values should be the instances of the key's class. So each
 * implementation of this interface should enforce that restriction.
