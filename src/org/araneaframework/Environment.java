/**
 * A special data structure providing encapsulation of data needed by different components. Every Aranea component has
 * an environment. The environment can be inherited from the parent or be standalone. No component knows from which
 * component the Environment comes from.
 * <p>
 * Component does know about the hooks in the environment. As different contexts are added to the environment the
 * component in need of them is responsible of checking them and acting upon them.
 * <p>
 * Environment is a also great tool for components defining "contexts" for their child components, since parent
 * components can add new items to (existing) environment and pass on to their children so that only they would see the
 * items.
