/**
 * Widget is a service with enhanced input and output data processing. It divides input-output processing into "legacy"
 * action-handling and new event handling, which consists of three phases in that particular order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>updating (<code>update(InputData)</code>)
 * <li>(targeted) event handling (<code>event(Path, InputData)</code>)
 * <li>rendering (<code>render(OutputData)</code>)
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Note that event handling takes place only when the widget was asked to perform a specific event, while updating and
 * rendering should take place on all widgets in active hierarchy.
 * <p>
 * <tt>Widget</tt> follows the template pattern by defining <code>_getWidget()</code> which returns the implementation.
 * The implementation is used for managing the widget input-output data processing. The <tt>Widget</tt> contract itself
 * does not expose direct input-output data processing methods, since they are protected and handled by implementations.
