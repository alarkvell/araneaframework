 * A filter service is a service, which filters requests to its child-service. A filter should override one of methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>action(Path, InputData, OutputData)</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * and does the filtering by allowing the action to be invoked on the child or not. This class is a skeleton which lets
 * all the requests through, sets the child, handles the initialization and destroying of the child.
 * <p>
 * The child is initialized with <code>getChildServiceEnvironment()</code> which, by default, returns this component's
 * Environment. For alternate environments it should be overridden.
